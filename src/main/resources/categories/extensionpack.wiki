==Extension Pack==

An extension pack (EP) is the result of a single Gap Analysis document with 
proposed extensions being submitted to FPL.

Extension packs are submitted by FPL Working Groups or Committees to the 
FIX Global Technical Committee for peer review and feedback.

Gap Analysis documents are based on a template provided by FPL and include 
background information, business requirements and message flows, 
not just changes to FIX messages, fields, values, etc.

In {{SITENAME}} the page for each FIX object - 
ie component, message, field, type or value - may display the 
extension pack in which that object was first added.
Not all pages display extension pack information because extension packs were
only introduced in later versions of FIX.
