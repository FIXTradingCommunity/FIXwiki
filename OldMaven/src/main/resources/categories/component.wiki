==FIX Components==

Component blocks are sets of related data fields grouped together and are referenced by the component block name in messages that they are used in.

Sometimes they are referred to as "Groups".

In {{SITENAME}} each component has a page which describes it.
The categories at the bottom of each component page show which messages (or higher level components) the given component appears in.

Each component page also has links to subpages which show which fields appear in the component for different
versions of FIX.

All component pages belong to the {{SITENAME}} category "Component".
