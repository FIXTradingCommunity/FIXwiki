<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/">FIXwiki</a> is a wiki
    whose core content is taken from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/">FIX Protocol
        Specification</a>.
    Wiki pages are generated automatically from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/repository/">FIX
        repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This document describes the Java and PHP code which is used to generate
    FIXwiki. It is intended for developers who are responsible for
    maintaining that code base.
</p>

<p>
    You should start by taking a look at the FIXwiki website
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/">http://fixwiki.org/</a>
    for high level information about FIXwiki.
    Particularly the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:Structure">Structure
        of FIXwiki</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:About">About
        FIXwiki</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    All code, data files, and this documentation are available from FPL's
    Subversion repository at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://svn.fixprotocol.org/svn/fixwiki">https://svn.fixprotocol.org/svn/fixwiki</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    Wiki Software
</h2>

<p>
    FIXwiki uses <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a>
    for the basic wiki software.
    There are numerous wiki implementations. However, MediaWiki was chosen
    because it is the software used for the world's largest and most active
    wiki, <a target="_blank" href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.
    This gave confidence that the software, whatever shortcomings it might have,
    would be highly scalable and highly reliable.
</p>

<p>
    FIXwiki's design was strongly influenced by the book
    <a target="_blank"
       href="http://www.amazon.com/Mediawiki-Wikipedia-Beyond-Daniel-Barrett/dp/0596519796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1292813546&sr=1-1">"MediaWiki"
        (Daniel J Barrett, published by O'Reilly)</a>. The FIXwiki developer
    will find that book a very useful reference.
</p>

<p>
    Mediawiki is built using <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
    PHP may not be everyone's favourite language. However it
    is Mediawiki's native language so the FIXwiki developer will need
    to acquire some basic knowledge of it.
</p>

<p>
    MediaWiki sits on top of a database. Theoretically that database does not
    have to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>,
    but MySQL is what is used by Wikipedia, so
    FIXwiki also uses MySQL on the assumption that it would be the most
    reliable partner for MediaWiki. Some attempts were made a while back
    to move FIXwiki to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
    and a whole bunch of problems arose. The project was eventually abandoned.
    So MySQL does indeed appear to be the best choice for MediaWiki.
    Fortunately, the operation of the underlying database is largely
    hidden, so the FIXwiki developer requires minimal knowledge of MySQL.
</p>

<h3>
    Installing MediaWiki
</h3>

<p>
    You can freely download the latest MediaWiki software from
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Unpack the MediaWiki distribution into a directory called "w" accessible
    to a web browser.
</p>

<p>
    See the INSTALL file of the unpacked distribution for installation
    instructions. Basically you just point your browser to the directory
    you unpacked into and then follow the instructions. Generally you can
    choose the default values. This is how you should fill in other values.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wiki name - FIXwiki</li>
    <li>Contact email - fpl@fixprotocol.org</li>
    <li>Admin user - Keep the default value "WikiSysop". Be sure to note down 
        the admin password you choose.
    </li>
    <li>MySQL database - Note also that you need to have a MySQL user name set
        up (using root is fine if you know it).
    </li>
    <li>
        Database name - fixwikidb. Not really necessary - the default name of 
        wikidb is OK but it might be handy to have a special name in case you 
        ever want to install a different wiki.
    </li>
    <li>
        Database table prefix - fw_. Not really necessary but probably a good
        idea.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once MediaWiki is installed, modify the standard MediaWiki LocalSettings.php
    so that it includes another file LocalSettings.inc.
    This file is where you will put the FIXwiki specific configuration settings.
    It can start off blank.
    You should add the following as the last line in LocalSettings.php: 
    <pre>
    include('LocalSettings.inc');    
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Lastly you should make the images subdirectory of the MediaWiki 
    installation writable. This is where uploaded files will be written. 
</p>
<h3>
    Standard Extensions Used by FIXwiki
</h3>

<p>
    FIXwiki uses the following standard extensions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmAccount">ConfirmAccount</a>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImportUsers">ImportUsers</a>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MaintenanceShell">MaintenanceShell</a>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions">ParserFunctions</a>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PasswordReset">PasswordReset</a>
    </li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SubPageList3">SubPageList3</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These need to be downloaded and unpacked into the wiki's "extensions"
    subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
    Once the extensions are present in the "extensions" subdirectory, you can
    copy the LocalSettings.inc across. See the following section.
</p>

<p>
    Note that the ConfirmAccount extension requires that some SQL is run on
    the underlying database as well. See the doc for that extension.
</p>

<h3>
    Email Support
</h3>

<p>
    If the computer that the wiki is running on does not have its own
    email support (eg through Postfix or Sendmail on a Linux box), then
    you have to install special PHP email support and you also need to
    specify email configuration details in LocalSettings.inc.
</p>
<p>
    The relevant configuration lines will already be in the standard 
    LocalSettings.inc. Comment them out if they are not needed.
    They are:
</p>
<pre>
    $wgSMTP = array(
     'host'     => "mail.angel.net", //could also be an IP address
     'IDHost'   => "fixwiki.fixprotocol.org",
     'port'     => 25,
     'auth'     => false
    );    
</pre>
<p>
    See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgSMTP">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgSMTP</a> 
    for detailed doc on the $wgSMTP config. 
</p>
<p>
    The PHP email support comes from the PEAR project which supplies all
    sorts of PHP libraries in the form of "packages". Specifically you 
    need the <a target="_blank" href="http://pear.php.net/package/Mail">Mail</a> package
    plus those packages that it depends on.
</p>
<h3>
    LocalSettings.inc
</h3>

<p>
    This file contains special configuration settings for FIXwiki,
    including the lines needed to complete the configuration of the standard
    wiki extensions mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
    The latest version of the file can be found in FPL's Subversion
    repository. A sample copy of the file appears in the Appendix below.
</p>

<p>
    This file should be in place and working as expected for the wiki before
    running the FIXwiki build script (described below).
    In particular, the url rewriting rules should be working correctly.
    Links in imported wiki pages will contain urls according to the 
    configured rules. These cannot be changed later.
</p>

<h2>
    Generating FIXwiki
</h2>

<p>
    There is a page in FIXwiki for every FIX message, component, field, value or
    type. The <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/repository/">FIX
    repository</a>
    contains the official definitions of all FIX
    messages, components, fields, values and types.
    So generating FIXwiki involves creating a wiki page for each of these
    FIX repository definitions.
</p>

<p>
    MediaWiki provides a standard PHP function (importTextFile.php) for creating
    a wiki page from the contents of a text file.
    So the software which generates FIXwiki copies each
    FIX repository definition into a text file and creates a PHP script which
    calls this import function for each text file. Running the resulting
    PHP script creates FIXwiki. This software is written in Java.
</p>

<p>
    To summarize, once the wiki is correctly configured, generating the FIXwiki 
    content (ie all the FIXwiki pages) is a two stage process:    
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the FIX repository and generate a number of text files and a PHP
        script which creates a wiki page from each file
    </li>
    <li>Run the generated PHP script</li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Generated Text Files
</h3>

<p>
    These are generated automatically from the FIX repository and other sources
    by the FIXwiki generation code (described below).
    There are around 20,000 data files totalling about 90Mb.
</p>

<p>
    These files will be imported into the wiki by running the build script
    which is generated along with the text files.
</p>

<h3>
    Generated Build Script
</h3>

<p>
    buildFIXwiki.sh is located in the root directory of the text files.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It needs to be run from the wiki's "maintenance" subdirectory.</li>
    <li>It needs to be run by a user with full update access to the MySQL 
        wiki database.
    </li>
    <li>The wiki needs to be fully configured using LocalSettings.inc as
        described above before running the script. In particular the url
        rewriting rules need to be functioning correctly.
    </li>
    <li>It can take 1 or 2 hours to complete.</li>
    <li>After the script has completed it can still take a while for subpages to
        display correctly. Until that is complete, you may see messages like
        "Page has no subpages to list".
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Running the build script will replace any existing specification
    wiki pages. However, it will not replace any user content pages.
</p>

<p>
    The command line to run the script (from the wiki "maintenance" directory)
    is simply:
</p>
<pre>
    sh &lt;path to data files root directory&gt;/buildFIXwiki.sh    
</pre>

<p>
    The rest of this document will describe the Java software that actually
    generates the text files and build script.
</p>

<h2>
    FIXwiki Generating Software
</h2>

<p>
    The software is kept in FPL's Subversion repository.
</p>

<p>
    It is broken up into the following modules.
</p>

<h3>RepoInfo - Processes the FIX repository files</h3>

<p>
    The FIX repository is in the form of a number of interrelated XML files.
    The files are arranged in a directory hierarchy.
    RepoInfo takes the root directory of a FIX repository and processes
    all the files in the repository into an internal Java object based
    representation.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, RepoInfo also process some extra files - defined as resources in
    the Java code - ie you will find them checked in with the Java source code.
    These extra files add more extensive definitions for messages, fields etc
    than what is currently held in the FIX repository.
    (These definitions come directly from the specification, however, so they
    are "official").
</p>

<p>
    The intention is that the FIX repository will eventually hold these
    "elaborated" definitions, but it does not currently. Part of the value
    of FIXwiki is that it contains these more complete definitions, so
    for now they need to be supplied by these extra files
    (ComponentDesc.xml, EnumDesc.xml, Glossary.txt, MessageDesc.xml).
</p>

<h3>LinkDetector - Detects links to other pages</h3>

<p>
    Many pages contain references to other pages. For example, the description
    about a given FIX message will typically mention some of the fields that
    make up the message. Each of these fields will have its own FIXwiki page
    and it is highly desirable for someone reading the message description
    to be able to quickly go to the page of a mentioned field by simply
    clicking on the field's name.
</p>

<p>
    LinkDetector processes the text files searching for such links and
    converting the text accordingly.
</p>

<h3>FixwikiUtil.formatDescription - Converts to Wiki formatted text</h3>

<p>
    MediaWiki uses some
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting">very
        simple rules for formatting text</a>.
    For example, you indicate a new paragraph by simply leaving a blank line.
    (Anyone who has contributed to Wikipedia will be familiar with these rules).
</p>

<p>
    This code scans the text files and attempts to convert them to
    use wiki formatting so that the text displays nicely in FIXwiki.
</p>

<h3>FixwikiGenerator - Generates page content and the PHP import script</h3>

<p>
    This is the main module of the FIXwiki generating code. It uses the
    other modules as required.
</p>

<p>
    Apart from calling the other modules as needed, the main function of this
    code is to actually generate the text files which end up being FIXwiki pages,
    as well as the PHP script which imports those text files into the wiki.
</p>

<h2>
    FIXwiki Templates
</h2>

<p>
    The generated FIXwiki pages use
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates">templates</a>
    to standardize the layout of pages.
    For example, pages that display information about FIX messages all have a
    common format - only the displayed data changes.
    FIXwiki imposes that common format by using a template called
    "Message info" to display the data on each message page.
    A template is like a Java method. It receives its data passed in as
    parameters and then does something with that data - eg displays the
    data on the page.
</p>

<p>
    For example, look at the source for the FIXwiki
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fixwiki.org/fixwiki/TestRequest">TestRequest
        page</a>.
    It will look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{{FPL:TestRequest}}

=Notes=
{{Invitation to post}}    
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In fact, most FIXwiki pages will look very similar to this. Two templates
    are called here: "FPL:TestRequest" and "Invitation to post".
    The "Invitation to post" displays the standard text inviting people to
    contribute. The "FPL:TestRequest" displays the contents of the
    TestRequest page in the protected FPL namespace. See the FIXwiki doc -
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:Structure">Structure
        of FIXwiki</a> - for a discussion of the use of namespaces.
    Basically we are making sure that users can't modify the part of
    FIXwiki that comes from the specification.
</p>

<p>
    If you look at the source of the page FPL:TestRequest you will see something
    like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{{Message info
| Description=The test request message forces a heartbeat...

| AbbrName=TestRequest
| MsgType=1
| Name=TestRequest
| ComponentID=2
| SectionID=Session
| CategoryID=Session
| NotReqXML=1
| added=FIX.2.7
| SegmentType=Message
}}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    As you can see, this calls the standard "Message info" template passing
    in all the data specific to the TestRequest message. You can look at
    all the templates, including the "Message info" template, by going to the
    special <a target="_blank"
               href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/Special:UncategorizedTemplates">Uncategorized
    templates page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This approach means that the appearance of all FIXwiki pages could be
    changed by simply modifying these formatting templates.
</p>
