# FIXwiki

This is the code that is used to generate the FIXwiki website, http://fixwiki.org/, from the FIX Protocol repository, http://fixprotocol.org/repository/

If you want to use FIXwiki - just go to the website at http://fixwiki.org/. This repository is only of interest to developers who are interested in how that website is generated and kept up to date.

##Introduction
