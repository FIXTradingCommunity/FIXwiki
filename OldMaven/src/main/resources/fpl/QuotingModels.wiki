==Introduction==

The [[FPL:Pre-trade_messages#Quotation_and_Negotiation|quotation messages]] fall into two main sub-categories Ð those used for quoting in single instruments  
"Single product quoting" and those used to quote on multiple instruments such as option series - "Mass quoting".

Within the "single product quoting" suite of messages three business models have been identified:

; Indicative quoting 
:the predominant business model for retail quoting, where the expected response to a quote is a Ôpreviously quotedÕ order which may be accepted or rejected. In the retail model the quote may be preceded by a [[QuoteRequest]]
; Tradeable quoting 
: a model where the response to a quote may be an execution (rather than an order). A common model where participants are posting quotes to an exchange. [[Quote]] may be issued in response to a [[QuoteRequest]] in a Ôquote on demandÕ market
; Restricted Tradeable quoting 
: as per Tradeable quoting but the  response to a quote may be either an execution or an order depending on various parameters. 

==Indicative Quoting Model==

FIX supports an Indicative Quoting Model that is frequently used between two counterparties. 
In the Indicative Quoting Model a party interested in a particular security issues a [[QuoteRequest]] to a 
counterparty. The counterparty responds with an indicative [[Quote]]. The first party - assuming the quote meets their 
requirements - can send back a [[NewOrderSingle]] ([[OrdType]] = PreviouslyQuoted). 
The [[NewOrderSingle]] message should contain the [[QuoteID]] of the [[Quote]]. 
The issuer of the quote does not necessarily have to execute the order - based upon market conditions or 
characteristics contained on the [[NewOrderSingle]] Message.

===Indicative Quoting Model Message Scenario===

!First Party

|[[QuoteRequest]]

This is an optional first step. Counterparties may agree to provide indicative quotes in a continuous manner.
|>>>>
|Accepts [[Quote]] Request

Creates a [[Quote]] for the product specified in the [[QuoteRequest]]

|-
|Accepts [[Quote]] - after examining market indicated in quote decides whether to place a [[NewOrderSingle]]
|<<<<
|Send [[Quote]] message (can be a one or two sided market). The [[QuoteReqID]] should be set to the [[QuoteReqID]] from the [[QuoteRequest]] to which this [[Quote]] is a response.
|-
|[[NewOrderSingle]] - should reference the [[QuoteID]] for which the New Order message in which the New Order is a response. The [[OrdType]] should be set to PreviouslyQuoted.
|>>>>
|Accepts the [[NewOrderSingle]] message.

Should be acknowledged as New.

|-
|
|<<<<
|Sends [[ExecutionReport]] for New (Optional)
|-
|
|<<<<
|Sends [[ExecutionReport]] [[OrdStatus]]=Filled if the order is acceptable or

Or

Send [[ExecutionReport]] [[OrdStatus]]=PartiallyFilled

Or

Send [[ExecutionReport]] [[OrdStatus]]=Rejected

|}

Indicative quotes can also be sent out on an unsolicited basis. The correct response is the [[NewOrderSingle]] 
(previously quoted) as above

==Tradeable Quote Model==

Beginning with FIX 4.2 support was provided for markets requiring tradeable quotes. 
A tradeable quote market has market makers or specialist issue quotes that are kept as part of a market. 
A tradeable quote can be directly traded against orders or other quotes (depending on market rules). 
The market created by these quotes should be distributed using the Market Data messages. 
When orders are entered in response to the markets created by the tradeable quotes - trades may result. 
Trades are reported with an [[ExecutionReport]].

Tradeable Quote model markets can be continuously quoted or quoted on demand or a combination of the two. 
In continuously quoted markets - market makers or specialists are required to maintain two sided markets which 
comply with market requirements for bid-ask spread and minimum quantity. 
In the quote on demand market - market makers and specialists are usually required to respond to [[QuoteRequest]]s 
(RFQs) within a market prescribed time limit with a quote which complies with exchange prescribed bid-ask spread and 
minimum quantity.

===Tradeable Quote Model - Reporting Quote Status back to Issuer===

The market should provide unsolicited quote status back to the quote issuer if the state of a quote changes with the 
exception of trades (fills) that occur against a quote. Trades (fills) are reported using the [[ExecutionReport]].

NOTE: The [[Quote]] Message should not be used to report trades. Only the [[ExecutionReport]] should be used to report 
fills against a tradeable or restricted tradeable quote.

|>>>>
|Accepts [[Quote]] and applies to the market
|-
|Accepts [[Quote]] and updates trading system based upon status reported by market
|<<<<
|Based upon market rules or the [[QuoteResponseLevel]] requested by Quote Issuer the market will send [[QuoteStatusReport]] messages back to the quote issuer to report quote status (using the [[QuoteStatus]] field).
|-
|
|<<<<
|If a trade (fill) occurs against a tradeable quote an [[ExecutionReport]] ([[ExecType]]=Fill or PartialFill) is sent to the quote issuer.
|}

===Using the [[ExecutionReport]] to report a trade on a Tradeable Quote===

The [[ExecutionReport]] should be used to report trades involving a tradeable quote. 
Because quotes are usually replaced or replenished - often times with the same [[QuoteID]] - it is not always possible, 
nor does it necessarily make sense for markets to keep track and transmit the detailed quantity information 
required on the quote. [[ExecutionReport]]s for trades against a tradeable quote can use the quantity fields in the 
following manner.

{|border="1"
|-
!Tag#
!Field Name
!Reqd
!Usage in reporting trades on tradeable or restricted tradeable quotes
|-
|38
|[[OrderQty]]

|-

|[[AvgPx]]

|Use 0.0 if market is unable to provide an average price
|}


===Tradeable Quote Model - Quote on Demand Message Scenario===

In the quote on demand model Ð markets are not necessarily available until someone interested in the market 
generates a request.

(Optionally can choose to replenish market or wait for next [[QuoteRequest]])

|}


===Tradeable Quote Model Message Scenario - Continuous markets===

The Tradeable Quote Model in a continuously quoted marketed Ð requires market makers or specialist to maintain market 
compliant two sided markets.

|-
|
|
|[[Quote]] is processed as above - market data is generated - an optional [[QuoteStatusReport]]  message is generated
|<<<<

|}


===Tradeable Quote Model - Querying for Quote Status===

Market participants may need to query the status of their current quotes. Normally a market will provide status in an 
unsolicited manner back to the quote issuer. However, to support system or session recovery Ð 
the [[QuoteStatusRequest]] can be used to query the current state of quotes within a market.

{|border="1"
|-
!Market maker or specialist
!
!Market
|-
|[[QuoteStatusRequest]]

|-
|Accepts [[Quote]] and updates trading system.
|<<<<
|Sends [[QuoteStatusReport]] messages with the [[QuoteStatus]] field set, bid and ask prices, and quantities for each quote belonging to the request issuer that meet the criteria in the request.

If there is a current quote in the market - the [[QuoteStatusReport]] in response to a [[QuoteStatusRequest]] should be sent with a [[QuoteStatus]] of "Query".

The [[QuoteStatusReport]] message can also contain a [[QuoteStatus]] of  "QuoteNotFound" if no quote currently exists.

|}


==Restricted Tradeable Quote Model==

The Restricted Tradeable Quote Model extends the behavior of the Tradeable Quote Model to place limits on quantity or 
price. Orders received against the Restricted Tradeable Quote that are within limits set by the market Ð will 
execute against the quote automatically Ð just as in the case of the Tradeable Quote Model.

If the order is outside the limits specified by the market Ð the order is forwarded to the quote issuer(s) to be filled, 
partially filled with remaining quantity cancelled, or canceled.

===Restricted Tradeable Quote Model Message Scenario===

The Restricted Tradeable Quote Model will automatically trade against orders within restrictions specified by the 
market in terms of quantity or price.

==Mass Quote Message Scenarios==

===Unsolicited quote(s) no response requested===

[[MassQuote]] is sent from first party to second party. 
The quote has the [[QuoteResponseLevel]] set to 0 or omitted. 
The second party does not acknowledge the quote. 
If the quote is later hit, resulting in a trade, an [[ExecutionReport]] is sent to the first party.

===Unsolicited quote(s) negative response only requested===

[[MassQuote]] is sent from first party to second party. 
The quote has the [[QuoteResponseLevel]] set to 1. 
The second party only acknowledges the quote if there is an error. 
If the second party encounters an error while processing the quote a [[MassQuoteAcknowledgement]] message is sent 
with the [[QuoteRejectReason]] set to the error encountered.

|<<<<

|}


===Cancel All Quotes===

The First Party asks the second party to cancel all quotes.  
Quotes with a quote status are sent in response to the cancel all quotes message ([[QuoteCancel]] with
[[QuoteCancelType]] = 4 (CancelAllQuotes)).

{|border="1"
|-
!First Party
!

[[QuoteCancelType]] = 4 (CancelAllQuotes)

|>>>>
|Interprets [[QuoteCancel]] message and cancels quotes.
|-
|Interpret [[MassQuoteAcknowledgement]]
|<<<<
|[[MassQuoteAcknowledgement]]
|}


==Use of other Quote Messages in Mass Quoting==

Once the [[MassQuote]] message is submitted to a market and after the initial 
[[MassQuoteAcknowledgement]] - the Quote Entries are treated as separate quotes. Report of [[QuoteStatus]] 
should be done using the [[QuoteStatusRequest]] and [[Quote]] messages. 
Fills are reported for each Quote Entry using the [[ExecutionReport]].

===Reporting [[QuoteStatus]] back to [[MassQuote]] Issuer===

Markets should report the status of quotes back to the quote issuer when the state of one of the quotes in 
a [[MassQuote]] changes. [[QuoteStatusReport]] messages should be issued for each change in state of a quote entry. 
The [[QuoteID]] of the original [[MassQuote]] message should be used as the [[QuoteID]] on the [[QuoteStatusReport]]. 
It is acceptable to append the [[QuoteSetID]] and [[QuoteEntryID]] to indicate the specific quote in the 
[[MassQuote]] message referred to in the [[QuoteStatusReport]] if this information is maintained by the market. 
NOTE: The [[Quote]] Message should not be used to report trades. 
Only the [[ExecutionReport]] should be used to report fills against a tradeable or restricted tradeable quote.

{|border="1"

|<<<<
|Based upon market rules or based upon the [[QuoteResponseLevel]] requested by Quote Issuer the market will send [[MassQuoteAcknowledgement]] message back to the quote issuer to report quote status in the [[QuoteStatus]] field.
|-
|Updates trading system with quote status
|<<<<
|[[Quote]] messages are sent back unsolicited as the quote state changes. The [[QuoteEntryID]] should be used as the [[QuoteID]].
|-
|Updates trading system with [[ExecutionReport]]
|<<<<
|If a trade (fill) occurs against a tradeable or restricted tradeable quote an [[ExecutionReport]] ([[ExecType]]=Trade) is sent to the quote issuer.
|}


===Querying for [[MassQuote]] Status===

If the issuer of a [[MassQuote]] queries the current status of the quote the market should reply with a 
sequence of individual quote messages with status. 
This is recommended to eliminate the need for markets to store [[QuoteSetID]]s and [[QuoteEntryID]]s 
that were provided as part of the [[MassQuote]] message. 
Also, as quote status is very dynamic data - sending quote status on securities as soon as it is available - 
instead of combining it into a single message - will provide more timely information to the quote issuer. 
The use of a [[QuoteStatusRequest]] for a [[MassQuote]] is provided as a method of recovery for market maker 
trading systems - due to the volume of information that can be generated and the short lived nature of quote status - 
this usage is not recommended for normal processing.

If there is a current quote in the market - the [[Quote]] in response to a [[QuoteStatusRequest]] should be sent with a [[QuoteStatus]] of "Query".

The [[Quote]] message can also contain a [[QuoteStatus]] of  "QuoteNotFound" if no quote currently exists.
