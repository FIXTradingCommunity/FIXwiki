Requiring a log in provides some basic protection against vandals.
It also allows better tracking of the use of {{SITENAME}}.

[[Special:UserLogin/signup|Registering for a log in account]] is quick and easy.
Any data entered by you when registering for a log in account (eg your email address) is treated as strictly 
confidential, for internal {{SITENAME}} use only.
