<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/">FIXwiki</a> is a wiki
    whose core content is taken from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/">FIX Protocol
        Specification</a>.
    Wiki pages are generated automatically from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/repository/">FIX
        repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This document describes the Java and PHP code which is used to generate
    FIXwiki. It is intended for developers who are responsible for
    maintaining that code base.
</p>

<p>
    You should start by taking a look at the FIXwiki website
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/">http://fixwiki.org/</a>
    for high level information about FIXwiki.
    Particularly the following sections:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:Structure">Structure
        of FIXwiki</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:About">About
        FIXwiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Wiki Software
</h2>

<p>
    FIXwiki uses <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a>
    for the basic wiki software.
    There are numerous wiki implementations. However, MediaWiki was chosen
    because it is the software used for the world's largest and most active
    wiki, <a target="_blank" href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.
    This gave confidence that the software, whatever shortcomings it might have,
    would be highly scalable and highly reliable.
</p>

<p>
    FIXwiki's design was strongly influenced by the book
    <a target="_blank"
       href="http://www.amazon.com/Mediawiki-Wikipedia-Beyond-Daniel-Barrett/dp/0596519796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1292813546&sr=1-1">"MediaWiki"
        (Daniel J Barrett, published by O'Reilly)</a>. The FIXwiki developer
    will find that book a very useful reference.
</p>

<p>
    Mediawiki is built using <a target="_blank"
                                href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.
    PHP may not be everyone's favourite language. However it
    is Mediawiki's native language so the FIXwiki developer will need
    to acquire some basic knowledge of it.
</p>

<p>
    MediaWiki sits on top of a database. Theoretically that database does not
    have to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>,
    but MySQL is what is used by Wikipedia, so
    FIXwiki also uses MySQL on the assumption that it would be the most
    reliable partner for MediaWiki. Some attempts were made a while back
    to move FIXwiki to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
    and a whole bunch of problems arose. The project was eventually abandoned.
    So MySQL does indeed appear to be the best choice for MediaWiki.
    Fortunately, the operation of the underlying database is largely
    hidden, so the FIXwiki developer requires minimal knowledge of MySQL.
</p>

<h2>
    Generating FIXwiki
</h2>

<p>
    There is a page in FIXwiki for every FIX message, component, field, value or
    type. The <a target="_blank" href="http://fixprotocol.org/repository/">FIX
    repository</a>
    contains the official definitions of all FIX
    messages, components, fields, values and types.
    So generating FIXwiki involves creating a wiki page for each of these
    FIX repository definitions.
</p>

<p>
    MediaWiki provides a standard PHP function (importTextFile.php) for creating
    a wiki page from the contents of a text file.
    So the software which generates FIXwiki copies each
    FIX repository definition into a text file and creates a PHP script which
    calls the PHP import function for each text file. Running the resulting
    PHP script creates FIXwiki. This software is written in Java.
</p>

<p>
    To summarize, generating FIXwiki is a two stage process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the FIX repository and generate a number of text files and a PHP
        script which creates a wiki page from each file
    </li>
    <li>Run the PHP script</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The rest of this document will describe the Java software that performs
    the first stage of the above process.
</p>

<h2>
    FIXwiki Generating Software
</h2>

<p>
    The software is broken up into the following modules.
</p>

<h3>RepoInfo - Processes the FIX repository files</h3>

<p>
    The FIX repository is in the form of a number of interrelated XML files.
    The files are arranged in a directory hierarchy.
    RepoInfo takes the root directory of a FIX repository and processes
    all the files in the repository into an internal Java object based
    representation.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, RepoInfo also process some extra files - defined as resources in
    the Java code - ie you will find them checked in with the Java source code.
    These extra files add more extensive definitions for messages, fields etc
    than what is currently held in the FIX repository.
    (These definitions come directly from the specification, however, so they
    are "official").
</p>
<p>
    The intention is that the FIX repository will eventually hold these
    "elaborated" definitions, but it does not currently. Part of the value
    of FIXwiki is that it contains these more complete definitions, so
    for now they need to be supplied by these extra files
    (ComponentDesc.xml, EnumDesc.xml, Glossary.txt, MessageDesc.xml).
</p>
<h3>LinkDetector - Detects links to other pages</h3>

<p>
    Many pages contain references to other pages. For example, the description
    about a given FIX message will typically mention some of the fields that
    make up the message. Each of these fields will have its own FIXwiki page
    and it is highly desirable for someone reading the message description
    to be able to quickly go to the page of a mentioned field by simply
    clicking on the field's name.
</p>

<p>
    LinkDetector processes the text files searching for such links and
    converting the text accordingly.
</p>

<h3>Converting to Wiki Text - FixwikiUtil.formatDescription</h3>

<p>
    MediaWiki uses some
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting">very
        simple rules for formatting text</a>.
    For example, you indicate a new paragraph by simply leaving a blank line.
    (Anyone who has contributed to Wikipedia will be familiar with these rules).
</p>

<p>
    This code scans the text files and attempts to convert them to
    use wiki formatting so that the text displays nicely in FIXwiki.
</p>

<h3>Generating PHP script - FixwikiGenerator</h3>

<p>
    This is the main module of the FIXwiki generating code. It uses the
    other modules as required.
</p>

<p>
    Apart from calling the other modules as needed, the main function of this
    code is to actually generate the PHP script which imports the text files
    which end up being FIXwiki pages.
</p>

<h2>
    FIXwiki Templates
</h2>

<p>
    The generated FIXwiki pages use
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates">templates</a>
    to standardize the layout of pages.
    For example, pages that display information about FIX messages all have a
    common format - only the displayed data changes.
    FIXwiki imposes that common format by using a template called
    "Message info" to display the data on each message page.
    A template is like a Java method. It receives its data passed in as
    parameters and then does something with that data - eg displays the
    data on the page.
</p>

<p>
    For example, look at the source for the FIXwiki
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fixwiki.org/fixwiki/TestRequest">TestRequest
        page</a>.
    It will look like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{{FPL:TestRequest}}

=Notes=
{{Invitation to post}}    
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In fact, most FIXwiki pages will look very similar to this. Two templates
    are called here: "FPL:TestRequest" and "Invitation to post".
    The "Invitation to post" displays the standard text inviting people to
    contribute. The "FPL:TestRequest" displays the contents of the
    TestRequest page in the protected FPL namespace. See the FIXwiki doc -
    <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/FIXwiki:Structure">Structure
        of FIXwiki</a> - for a discussion of the use of namespaces.
    Basically we are making sure that users can't modify the part of
    FIXwiki that comes from the specification.
</p>

<p>
    If you look at the source of the page FPL:TestRequest you will see something
    like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{{Message info
| AbbrName=TestRequest
| MsgType=1
| ComponentType=Message
| MessageName=TestRequest
| MsgID=2
| Section=Session
| NotReqXML=1
| OverrideAbbr=TestRequest
| Volume=Volume2
| Category=Session
| Description=The test request message forces a heartbeat...

| FromVersion=FIX.4.0
| SegmentType=Message
}}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    As you can see, this calls the standard "Message info" template passing
    in all the data specific to the TestRequest message. You can look at
    all the templates, including the "Message info" template, by going to the
    special <a target="_blank" href="http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/Special:UncategorizedTemplates">Uncategorized templates page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This approach means that the appearance of all FIXwiki pages could be
    changed by simply modifying these formatting templates.
