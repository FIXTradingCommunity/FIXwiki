    <ComponentName>Instrument</ComponentName>
    <Desc>
      The Instrument component block contains all the fields commonly used to describe a security or instrument. Typically the data elements in this component block are considered the static data of a security, data that may be commonly found in a security master database. The Instrument component block can be used to describe any asset type supported by FIX.

  <ComponentDesc>
    <ComponentName>UnderlyingInstrument</ComponentName>
    <Desc>
      The UnderlyingInstrument component block, like the Instrument component block, contains all the fields commonly used to describe a security or instrument.  In the case of the UnderlyingInstrument component block it describes  an instrument which underlies the primary instrument Refer to the Instrument component block comments as this component block mirrors Instrument, except for the noted fields.

    <ComponentName>
     InstrumentLeg
    </ComponentName>
    <Desc>
      The InstrumentLeg component block, like the Instrument component block, contains all the fields commonly used to describe a security or instrument.  In the case of the InstrumentLeg component block it describes a security used in multileg-oriented messages.
      Refer to the Instrument component block comments as this component block mirrors Instrument, except for the noted fields.
      Several multileg-oriented messages specify an Instrument Leg component block. An instrument can have zero or more instrument legs. The fundamental business rule that applies to the multileg instrument is that the multileg instrument is defined as the combination of instrument legs. The multileg instrument must be able to be traded atomically – that all instrument legs are traded or none are traded.
      The LegRatioQty[623] is used to define the quantity of the leg that makes up a single unit of the multleg instrument. An option butterfly strategy is made up of three option legs.
