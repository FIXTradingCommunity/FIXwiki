See [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Search MediaWiki's standard search help].

By default, only user contributions are searched (ie the main or blank namespace). 
If you want to search other areas - for example the FPL namespace which contains content from the FIX specification - 
you can specify that by selecting your desired namespaces in the [[Special:Search|Search page]] that displays in 
response to your initial search request.

Alternately you can prefix your entered search text with the namespace you want to search. 
For example, enter "fpl:cross" and press the Search button to look for all references to the word "cross" in the 
FIX specification content (FPL namespace).
Or enter "all:cross" to find references to "cross" in any namespace.

(Note that FPL namespace pages do not display directly since they are intended only for inclusion in the main namespace 
pages. To view FPL page content just follow the displayed link to the corresponding main namespace page.
It includes the contents of its FPL counterpart.)
