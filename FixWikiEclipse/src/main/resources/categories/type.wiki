==FIX Types==

All FIX values have a data type.

Note that all data types (with the exception of those of type "data") are mapped to ASCII strings.

In {{SITENAME}} each type has a page which describes it.
The name of the type page is constructed from the type name followed by "DataType".

All type pages belong to the {{SITENAME}} category "Type".
