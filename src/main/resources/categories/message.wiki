==FIX Messages==

Messages are lists of fields and components. Each message has a message type (defined by its [[MsgType]] field).

In {{SITENAME}} each message has a page which describes it.

Each message page has links to subpages which show which fields appear in the message for different
versions of FIX.

All message pages belong to the {{SITENAME}} category "Message".
