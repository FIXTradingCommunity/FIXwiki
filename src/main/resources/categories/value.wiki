==FIX Values==

Every field in a message has a value. Every field value has a data type.
In addition, some fields can only take a restricted set of special field values.

Fields with a restricted set of special values are said to have "enumerated" values.

In {{SITENAME}} each special field value has a page which describes it.
The name of the value page is constructed from the field name, special value and value name as follows:

<code>
  FieldName/Value ValueName
</code>

All value pages belong to the {{SITENAME}} category "Value".
