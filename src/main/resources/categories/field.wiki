A FIX message is an ordered sequence of FIX fields. A field is identified by a unique tag number and a name. Each field in a message is associated with a value.

In {{SITENAME}} each field has a page which describes it.
The categories at the bottom of each field page show which messages or components the given field appears in.

All field pages belong to the {{SITENAME}} category "Field".
